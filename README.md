# Assignment 1

We need a User, having at least a username and a password. It needs an Id of type int.
We need a Post. It’s written by a User. It contains a Title and a Body. It also needs an Id of type int.
A User can also write a Comment on a Post. A Comment contains a Body, and an Id of type int.

All entities must have an Id of type int.

Based on the above requirements, you must create a domain model diagram, where we can see:

- The entities of the system
- The properties (attributes) on the entities
- The relationships between entities, e.g. Post is written by a User. Remember multiplicities at both ends, like you were taught for the Entity Relationship Diagram in DBS, or the Domain Model in SWE.
